            <p>1 1/2 cups fresh cherries, pitted
                <br>
                1/2 cup all-purpose flour
                <br>
                1/2 cup granulated sugar
                <br>
                1/4 teaspoon salt
                <br>
                3 large eggs
                <br>
                1 cup milk
                <br>
                1 teaspoon almond extract
                <br>
                1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
                <br>
                Powdered sugar, for dusting (optional)
                <br>
                <br>
                Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch (23 cm) round baking dish or pie pan.
                <br>

                Arrange the pitted cherries in a single layer in the greased baking dish.
                <br>
                
                In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, and salt.
                <br>
                
                In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, almond extract, and vanilla extract until well combined.
                <br>
                Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, whisking until you have a smooth batter.
                <br>
                
                Pour the batter evenly over the cherries in the baking dish.
                <br>
                Bake in the preheated oven for about 35-40 minutes or until the clafoutis is set and the top is lightly golden.
                <br>
                Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly. The clafoutis will deflate a bit as it cools.
                <br>
                Dust the top with powdered sugar for a decorative finish (optional).
                <br>
                Serve the cherry almond clafoutis warm or at room temperature. It's delicious on its own or with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
                <br>
                This cherry almond clafoutis is a classic French dessert that showcases the natural sweetness of fresh cherries. It's easy to make and makes for an elegant and delightful treat.
