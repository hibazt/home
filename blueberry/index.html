                    <h2>Blueberry</h2><hr>
                    
            <p>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
                <br>
                1/2 cup granulated sugar
                <br>
                2 tsp baking powder
                <br>
                1/2 tsp baking soda
                <br>
                1/4 tsp salt
                <br>
                1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled
                <br>
                2/3 cup buttermilk
                <br>
                2 large eggs
                <br>
                1 tsp vanilla extract
                <br>
                1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries
                <br>
                Optional: 1 tbsp lemon zest for extra flavor
                <br>
                Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly.
                <br>
                <br>

                In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. If you're using lemon zest for extra flavor, add it to the dry ingredients and mix well.
                <br>
                
                In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and then add the melted butter, buttermilk, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.
                <br>
                
                Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; it's okay if there are a few lumps in the batter.
                <br>
                
                Gently fold in the fresh blueberries.
                <br>
                
                Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full.
                <br>
                
                Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs.
                <br>
                
                Allow the muffins to cool in the muffin tin for about 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
                <br>
                
                Serve the blueberry muffins as a delicious breakfast treat or snack.
                <br>
                
                These homemade blueberry muffins are bursting with juicy blueberries and have a delightful, tender crumb. Enjoy them warm or at room temperature for a delightful treat.
