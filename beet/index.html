            <p>2 medium beets, washed and peeled
                <br>
                2 ounces (about 1/4 cup) goat cheese, crumbled
                <br>
                1/4 cup chopped walnuts
                <br>
                2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
                <br>
                1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
                <br>
                Salt and pepper, to taste
                Fresh parsley or arugula for garnish (optional)
                <br>
                <br>
                Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).

                Cut the peeled beets into small, bite-sized cubes or slices.
                
                Place the beet cubes on a baking sheet, drizzle with a bit of olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss to coat evenly.
                <br>
                
                Roast the beets in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes or until they are tender and slightly caramelized. You can test their doneness by poking them with a fork; they should be soft.
                <br>
                
                While the beets are roasting, toast the chopped walnuts in a dry skillet over medium-low heat for a few minutes until they become fragrant. Keep a close eye on them, as they can burn quickly.
                <br>
                
                Once the beets are done roasting, let them cool for a few minutes.
                <br>
                
                In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining olive oil and balsamic vinegar to create a simple vinaigrette. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
                <br>
                
                Place the roasted beets on a serving platter or individual plates. Sprinkle the crumbled goat cheese and toasted walnuts on top.
                <br>
                
                Drizzle the vinaigrette over the salad.
                <br>
                
                If desired, garnish with fresh parsley or arugula for a pop of color.
